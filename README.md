**<h2>Life Cycle Assessment of LFP and NMC Battery Production in Nevada, USA</h2>**

**Background**

Today, the world is facing one of its major challenges, which is transitioning electricity generation from
conventional sources, i.e., fossil fuels, to sustainable ones. This shift requires highly efficient energy storage
technologies, namely batteries. Despite several impressive advancements in harvesting sustainable energy in
recent years, such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, and solar panels, there is still significant room for
improvement in energy storage devices. And, the most used batteries today for this purpose is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries.

**Aim of project** </br> This project studies and compares the sustainability of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries considering three sustainability metrices 
* Environmental
* Economic and
* Social 
And, the Cradle to Gate method of LCA.

**Considered Location**,</br>
LFP Process Geographical Location: Gigafactory (Panasonic), Storey County, Nevada, United States
NMC Process Geographical Location: Dragonfly Energy, Old Virginia Rd, Reno, Nevada, United States

**Findings** </br>Environmental Impact: NMC batteries have fewer environmental pollutants compared to LFP batteries.  
Economic Metrics: Despite higher production costs, NMC batteries have greater economic viability due to higher gross revenues.  
Social Impact: Both battery types contribute to job creation, but mining for both processes has displaced indigenous communities.  
Stakeholder Interests: NMC aligns better with government environmental regulations and stakeholder priorities.  
Technological Advantage: NMC batteries are more efficient for electric vehicles due to higher energy density and better performance in cold climates.  

**Final Verdict: NMC batteries are identified as a more sustainable and viable option than LFP batteries.**
