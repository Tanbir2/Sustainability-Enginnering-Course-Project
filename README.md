# Sustainability-Enginnering-Course-Project

#Title of the Project:

#Life Cycle Assessment of LFP and NMC Battery Production in Nevada, USA

#Summary:

The project compares the sustainability of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries considerring three sustainability meticcs 
*environmental
*economic and
*social 

And, the Cradle to Gate method of LCA.


#Environmental Impact: NMC batteries have fewer environmental pollutants compared to LFP batteries.
#Economic Metrics: Despite higher production costs, NMC batteries have greater economic viability due to higher gross revenues.
#Social Impact: Both battery types contribute to job creation, but mining for both processes has displaced indigenous communities.
#Stakeholder Interests: NMC aligns better with government environmental regulations and stakeholder priorities.
#Technological Advantage: NMC batteries are more efficient for electric vehicles due to higher energy density and better performance in cold climates.

#Final Verdict: NMC batteries are identified as a more sustainable and viable option than LFP batteries.
